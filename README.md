<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project took a dataset of users visiting an eCommerce site who either saw a newly designed page, or the original design. Conversion rates were measured. 

### Built With

* Jupyter Notebooks
* Pandas/Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels
* Scipy


<!-- SKILLS -->
## Skills

A raw data file was provided, so a large part of this project involved cleaning the data. For example, a significant number of users were miscoded where they were marked as being part of the experimental group when they still saw the old page design, and vice versa.

Three forms of statistical analysis were performed. 

* Simple statistical analysis of the dataset.
* Hypothesis testing for difference of the mean. 
* Regression analysis for correlation. 


<!-- FINDINGS -->
## Findings

For this particular data set, it was found that there was no difference between the old page and the new page in conversion rates.
